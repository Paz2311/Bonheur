   Hi everybody, Bonjour à tous,
   Quick question for a tattoo..Petite question posée par un ami en vue
   d'un tatouage.
   Comment traduiriez-vous cette phrase?
   A la recherche du bonheur qui est peut-être derrière moi.
   Je pensais à : Pursuing the happiness that may be behind me
   mais le "the happiness" sonne bizarre.
   Merci pour votre aide. Thanks for your help.

   Do you mean "behind you" as in it's already happened /gone? Or "right
   behind me" like it's really close?
   Anyway "the happiness" to me sounds fine with this sentence structure.
   I might add something though to clarify what it means, like "Pursuing
   the happiness that may already be behind me" Or "Pursuing the happiness
   that may already have passed"
   Please listen to other people's suggestions too, I hope they give some!

   Bonjour,
   je l'aurais traduit comme ça :
   searching for happiness now gone/done.
   en quête du bonheur maintenant parti/fini.
